# D'espace - Decentralized Space
D'espace is an interactive web-app used for beginners and young learners to know about the web3 space and introduce them to the world of decentralization.

## What is D'espace: 
Well - if you go to google and search for the term, it gives you a translation from French to English as *of space* but for the project created, the idea was to create *Decentralized Space* and thus combining English and French, it has come to **D'espace**. 

## The idea behind D'espace:
The thoughts of creating D'espace was basically to teach young learners and beginners to teach them about web3 and decentralization in concepts of "world", being in a world that is decentralized. Learning can be fun with good visuals!

## Technologies used to build D'espace:
To create the functionality and looks: HTML and CSS were used
To create themes of Parallax, Javascript and CSS has been used
Credits for pictures: All the images and vectors used in the website have been taken from Freepik 
Git and GitHub: Git and Github have been for version control of the website
Deployed on: The project has been deployed on Vercel

## Problems faced during the creation:
This was my first hackathon experience as well as first time that I have been creating a website on my own. I have not worked with flex-box in CSS or parallax website before and it was difficult to make the page responsive.

While creating the png parts used for the UI of the website, it was difficult to select portions from the images to create appropriate images that can be used as png. That part took a lot of time to crop of each element cleanly.

The responsiveness of the website has been a huge challenge while creating the website. The problem has not been solved yet but I plan to fix it soon!

## Learnings:
I was able to learn flex-box and was able to move things with it. It was great to work for so many hours, I have not created a huge project but I am proud of the website I could build.

## The future: 
I am really happy with how the website has turned out, I plan on making it a mini interactive web-game where everyone can learn through bit-sized knowledge pop-up boxes.
